# Roles Array Issue - FIXED

## Problem Identified:
The `sanitizeObject` function was treating arrays as objects and converting them incorrectly, causing the roles array to lose its array type.

## Root Cause:
```javascript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN)
} else if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {
  sanitized[key] = sanitizeObject(value);  // This treated arrays as objects!
}
```

Arrays in JavaScript have `typeof array === 'object'`, so they were being processed as objects instead of arrays.

## Solution:
```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
} else if (Array.isArray(value)) {
  // Handle arrays specially - just sanitize each string element
  sanitized[key] = value.map(item =>
    typeof item === 'string' ? sanitizeString(item) : item
  );
} else if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {
  sanitized[key] = sanitizeObject(value);
}
```

Now arrays are detected first and handled properly, preserving their array type.

## Additional Debugging:
Added detailed logging to track:
- Raw roles array before sanitization
- Sanitized roles array after sanitization
- Type checking with `Array.isArray()`

## Expected Result:
Your registration with roles `['main_escrow', 'secondary_escrow']` should now work perfectly!
