# Registration Fixes - Version 2

## Fixed Issues:

### 1. Username Validation ✅
- **Before**: Only allowed letters, numbers, underscore, hyphen
- **After**: Allows ANY characters (including @ . + etc.)
- **Result**: "ajpbyu@byu.edu" is now valid

### 2. Password Requirements ✅
- **Before**: 8+ characters, simple validation
- **After**: 12+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character (@$!%*?&)
- **Updated**: Frontend help text to match new requirements

### 3. Roles Array Issue ✅
- **Added**: Better debugging to see what's being sent
- **Added**: Console logging to track roles array processing
- **Added**: More detailed error messages
