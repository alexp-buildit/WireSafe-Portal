# Registration Issue Fixed

## Changes Made:

### 1. Relaxed Validation Rules
- **Username**: Now allows underscores and hyphens (ajp_byu, test-user)
- **Phone**: More flexible format (accepts periods, spaces, parentheses)
- **Password**: Removed complex character requirements (just needs 8+ characters)

### 2. Better Error Messages
- Added detailed error logging on server
- Frontend now shows specific validation errors
- Console logging for debugging

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Server logs registration attempts (without passwords)
- Better error response structure
- More helpful user feedback

## Test Again:
Try registering with the same information. You should now either:
1. Successfully create an account, OR
2. See a specific error message explaining what needs to be fixed

The most likely fix was the password validation - it previously required uppercase, lowercase, numbers, AND special characters.
